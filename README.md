# Python-Based-Automated-Verilog-Code-Generator-For-Arithmetic-Unit
This Project has been done under the mentorship of prof. Joycee Mekie @ IIT Gandhinagar. The project contains tools to generate codes and implementation of arithmetic operations on a FPGA. 

#### Step 1: 
Open the command prompt and start the server by the command "python manage.py runserver".

#### Step 3.1: 
####
There are four weeks tab available on the right side of the webpage. Click on any of the weeks to view the contents the corresponding tab.
####

#### Step 3.2:
####
Choose any of the adder or divider or multiplier and give the number of bits and the name of the module you want as the input in the section provided on the webpage.
####
#### Step 4: 
####
* Click on the button, after clicking, the command prompt will start showing the implementation process. 
* This process will take about 20-30 mintues, depending on the length of the code.The implementation will start on the FPGA(make sure that your FPGA is connected to your computer) of the generated code. 
* For this, the path of the vivado.bat file should be in the environment variables. 
  * The PC running the software should have Vivado 2018 or above version installed. 
###

####
#### Step 5: 
####
* Open the teraterm software and connect it to the basys 3 board.
  * Teraterm is used to give input to basys 3. 
  * The input is given in hexadecimal system. We can give 2 numbers of  N bits as input in the teraterm. 
  * First 8 LED's on the FPGA will show the input and the button top button will be used to traverse throught the input. 
####
####
   * The LED's will increament like a counter as the inputs are given. The right button will be used to show output and the top button        will again be used to traverse through the output bits.

#####

  * Since the inputs are given in hex system, the output is also in hex system. The output can be shown on a 7 segment hex display.         Note, the dot on the 7 segment display will show the mark of an MSB bit.

The generated files can be seen in the respective folders of multipler, divider and adders.

The generated code is structural and only has a combinational circuit.

Week 1:
1. Array Multiplier: 


Week 2:
1. Kogge Stone adder: 
Like the carry-look ahead adder, it also produces Generate and Propagate bits at each stage, and it is also a parallel prefix adder. Only, the difference occurs in the carry look ahead adder.

2. Carry look ahead adder:
Primarily, at each stage, a “generate” and a “propagate” bit is generated. The Propagate bit comprises of the XOR operation and the Generate bit, the AND operation. For inputs of length, it takes O(log n) of computation time.

3. Carry select adder: It is a quite simple yet effective method to implement an adder. It computes the (n+1) bit sum of the two input arrays of length n, with a gate level depth of O(√n). It basically consists of two ripple carry adder along with MUXes at each stage.

Week 3:
1. Wallace tree multiplier: It has three steps: Multiplying each bit with another, and grouping the bits with same “weight”, reducing the number of partial products with half and full adders, group wires in two numbers and add them with an adder.

Week 4:
1. Restoring Array divider:
It divides two unsigned integers, returning the quotient and remainder. As compared to the other division algorithms, this algorithm is rather slower and closely resembles the division algorithm done by hand. The division follows a fixed algorithm. 
In the first step, the registers are initialized as follows: A: Dividend, B: Divisor, C: 0 and, N= number of bits in the dividend.
The second step involves shifting right the contents of CA as if they are a single unit. In the third step, B is subtracted from C and the result is stored in C. In the fourth step, the MSB of C is observed. If it is 1(or 0), then the least significant bit of A is set to 0(or 1). Also, the contents of C is restored with the value that was before the subtraction operation. The next step involves decrementing the value of counter N. If the value of N becomes 0, then the loop is discontinued, otherwise the above steps (from the second step) is repeated. The register A contains the quotient and C contains the remainder. 
The above steps are done in the "sub" module of the generated code of the verilog. It is done becuase the behavioral code is directly converted to structral code by increasing the space complexity from O(n) to O(n^2).
This module is called repeatedly so that the division algorithm can be performed. 

2. Booth multiplier: 
It multiplies two signed binary numbers in 2’s complement form. The algorithm proceeds by comparing the least significant of the multiplier, and another dummy register, initialised with the value zero. For the various cases, shifting operations are performed and the dummy register is updated by the additions or subtractions as required.
